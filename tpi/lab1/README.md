# Laboratory work nr. 1

Welcome young ones, to the first probability theory lab. Here you have the opportunity to tap into the ancient and sacred art of probability. By solving the following exercises you'll undergo a unique training that will open the door to new opportunities and adventures.

#### Note
The exercises will be solved using **Python** programming language. I know that most of you are accustomed only to **C**, but don't worry **Python** is a high level language *(soon I'll give you some insight about high level languages)* that is really easy to learn. Using **Python** you can easily prototype solutions to your problems due to the fact that it's backed up by many libraries that cover a large spectrum of domains.

### Python environment setup
I assume that most of you runs a Windows machine that's why I *(strongly)*recommend installing **Anaconda** environment. It comes with a python interpreter *(more bout interpreting and compiling source code click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaj7nO1HUqA))* an editor and a REPL *(something that executes instantly every line of code that you type)* and also it has tons of useful libraries required by lab exercises. Here is the [official anaconda page](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) where you can download the application.

#### Note
When you'll google `"Python"`, you might stumble upon different versions of it. **Python 2.7** is the old one and **Python 3.x** is the new one. Of corse we'll be using the new one. They actually are two different programming languages (though might not look very different). Please do not mistake the python version.


##### Tip
Try to include the python version in your *Google query*, ex: `"I have the some specific error python 3"`. This approach might help you to find faster the solution.

### A crash course to Python
[In this link](https://github.com/sergiu-terman/labs/blob/master/tpi/lab1/python_crash_course.md) is a long list of code snippets with explanatory comments. Please go thoroughly through them and try to understand most of them. After you succeed you will be ready to solve  the exercises. [Here you can find the original source](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/) of code snippets, that is just in case if the trimmed version was not enough for you. I strongly recommend not to go through it unless you're not a beginner to python, or you're accustomed to some other OOP (Object Oriented Programming) languages.
