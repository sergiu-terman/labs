# Laboratory work nr. 1

Welcome young ones, to the first probability theory lab.  Here you the opportunity to tap into the ancient art of probability. By solving the following exercises you'll undergo a unique training that will open the door to new opportunities and adventures.

#### Note
The exercises will be solved using **Python** programming language. I know that most of you are accustomed only to **C**, but don't worry **Python** is a high level language *(soon I'll give you some insight about high level languages)* that is really easy to learn. Using **Python** you can easily prototype solutions to your problems due to the fact that it's backed up by many libraries that covers a large spectrum of topics.

### Python environment setup
I assume that most of you runs a Windows machine that's why i recommend installing **Anaconda** environment. It comes with a python interpreter *(more bout interpreting and compiling source code click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaj7nO1HUqA))* an editor and a REPL *(something that executes instantly every line of code that you type)* and also it has tons of useful libraries that you're going to use. Long story short, it has everything you need to run complete the laboratory work. Here is the [official anaconda page](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)  where you can download the application.

## ACHTUNG !!!1
Currently there are *2 Pythons*. **Python 2.7** the old one and **Python 3.x** the new one. Of corse we'll be using the new one. They actually are two different programming languages (though might not look very different). Please do not mistake the python version. Another tip is to try to include the python version in your *Google queries*, ex: `I have the some specific error python 3`. This approach might help you find faster the solution to your problem. I repeat we'll be using **PYTHON 3!!!!!**
